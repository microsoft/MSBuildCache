## Building

### Building MSBuildCache

You can build `MSBuildCache.sln` and/or open it in VS.

### Using a custom MSBuild (optional)

Clone the [MSBuild repo](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild) adjacent to the MSBuildCache repo.

The remaining steps assume the `cwd` is the root of the MSBuildCache repo. You may need to adjust the paths if this is not the case.

Build the msbuild repo:
```
..\msbuild\build.cmd /p:CreateBootstrap=true /p:Configuration=Release
```
Note, MSBuild only needs to be built every time you update MSBuild, not every time you want to build MSBuildCache.

The path to MSBuild is: `..\msbuild\artifacts\bin\bootstrap\net472\MSBuild\Current\Bin\amd64\MSBuild.exe`.

Note: when using a locally built MSBuild, many scenario may not work properly, for example C++ builds.

## Testing

### Running

Ensure you've built MSBuildCache as described above.

Now add the following package source to your test repo's `NuGet.config`:

```xml
<add key="MSBuildCache" value="..\MSBuildCache\artifacts\Debug\Microsoft.MSBuildCache" />
```

You may need to adjust the above path based on the paths to your test repo and MSBuildCache.

Finally, add a `PackageReference` to MSBuildCache to your test repo with version `*-*` to use the latest MSBuildCache version. This may look different from repo to repo, but here is an example:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.MSBuildCache" VersionOverride="*-*" IncludeAssets="Analyzers;Build;BuildMultitargeting;BuildTransitive" PrivateAssets="All" />
```

**NOTE!** Because you're using a locally built package, you may need to clear it from your package cache after each iteration via a command like `rmdir /S /Q %NUGET_PACKAGES%\Microsoft.MSBuildCache` (if you set `%NUGET_PACKAGES%`) or `rmdir /S /Q %USERPROFILE%\.nuget\packages\Microsoft.MSBuildCache` if you're using the dfault package cache location. Additionally, to ensure you're not using the head version of the package, you may need to create a branch and dummy commit locally to ensure the version is higher.

**NOTE!** MSBuildCache currently does not handle incremental builds well! The current target scenario is for CI environments, so **it's expected that the repo is always clean before building**. The main reason for this gap is because file probes and directory enumerations are not currently considered.

To enable file reporting via detours in MSBuild, ensure `/graph` and `/reportfileaccesses` are used.

Example of a set of commands to test MSBuildCache e2e in some repo:

```
rmdir /S /Q %USERPROFILE%\.nuget\packages\Microsoft.MSBuildCache
git clean -fdx
<path-to-msbuild> /restore /graph /m /nr:false /reportfileaccesses
```

Example of a set of commands to test MSBuildCache e2e in a subdirectory of some repo:

```
rmdir /S /Q %USERPROFILE%\.nuget\packages\Microsoft.MSBuildCache
pushd <repo-root>
git clean -fdx
popd
<path-to-msbuild> /restore /graph /m /nr:false /reportfileaccesses
```

### Settings

There is a built-in mechanism to passing settings to a plugin, which is to add metadata to the `ProjectCachePlugin` item. This is then exposed to the plugin via the `CacheContext` during initialialization.

To add additional settings, add it to [`PluginSettings`](src\Common\PluginSettings.cs) and [`Microsoft.MSBuildCache.Common.targets`](src\Common\build\Microsoft.MSBuildCache.Common.targets). By convention the MSBuild property name should be the setting name prefixed by "MSBuildCache".
